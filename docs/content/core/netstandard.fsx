# .NET Standard / .NET Core support #

This is very initial / experimental, from version 1.1.12-alpha8.

Install e.g. with: `dotnet add package SQLProvider --version 1.1.12-alpha8`

## Example project ##

There are some example .NET-Coreapp 2.0 projects at: [tests\SqlProvider.Core.Tests](https://github.com/fsprojects/SQLProvider/tree/netstandard/tests/SqlProvider.Core.Tests)

There is a build.cmd which runs as follows:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Limitations ##

You need your database connection driver to also support .NET Core.
If your database connection driver has external dependencies, they have to be also present
(e.g. a project prebuild-task to move them to resolution path).

If you plan to run Microsoft SQL Server, you need a dependency to System.Data.SqlClient and a post-build task to
copy correct dll from under `System.Data.SqlClient\runtimes\...\` to your execution folder.

The providers that are not included in .NET-Standard version:

* Ms-Access in not supported
* Odbc is not supported

Connection string can be passed as hard-coded static parameter (development) or `GetDataContext(connectionstring)` but fetching it automatically from the application configuration is not supported.

.NET Standard solution is located at `/src/SQLProvider.Standard/SQLProvider.Standard.fsproj`

The target frameworks are defined in the project file: `<TargetFrameworks>net461;netcoreapp2.0;netstandard2.0</TargetFrameworks>`
Corresponding files goes to root bin paths, e.g.: \bin\netstandard2.0

Build is not tested with Mono, so .Net Standard build is disabled from build.fsx on Mono.

## Some Technical Details ##

Sources are in the [netstandard branch](https://github.com/fsprojects/SQLProvider/tree/netstandard).

The following files is needed to the NuGet package, from the .NET Standard SDK:
netstandard.dll, System.Console.dll, System.IO.dll, System.Reflection.dll, System.Runtime.dll

You can find net461 versions of them by default from:
C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\2.0.0\Microsoft\Microsoft.NET.Build.Extensions\net461\lib\

and also System.Data.SqlClient.dll from that NuGet package.

The NuGet cache is located at:
`C:\Users\(your-user-name)\.nuget\packages\SQLProvider\`
